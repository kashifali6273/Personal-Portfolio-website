      date: "September 2025",
      intro:
        "Code-mixed languages like Urdu-English or Roman-Urdu challenge NLP systems due to mixed grammar and scripts...",
      details:
        "In this blog, I share my research on fine-tuning multilingual models such as XLM-RoBERTa and mBERT on code-mixed datasets (like LinCE and custom Urdu-English corpora). I cover preprocessing, tokenization, and evaluation using accuracy and F1-scores, and explain how multilingual fine-tuning improves sentiment and intent detection tasks. Deliverables include a GitHub repo, demo app (Streamlit/Flask), and a research blog write-up."

      date: "August 2025",
      intro:
        "AI can improve healthcare access by predicting chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease early...",
      details:
        "This blog explains how I built ML and deep learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, TensorFlow) for disease prediction using open datasets. I also integrated a Generative AI chatbot (LangChain + RAG) to explain risk scores in plain language. The project includes MLOps-style deployment using Flask/Streamlit, with optional cloud hosting, making it both practical and impactful for real-world healthcare solutions."

      date: "July 2025",
      intro:
        "Satellite imagery combined with AI offers powerful tools to track deforestation, urbanization, and climate impacts...",
      details:
        "In this blog, I discuss how I used Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery with PySpark/Dask for preprocessing at scale, and trained CNNs and Vision Transformers for classification and segmentation. I evaluated models using IoU, Accuracy, and F1-score, and applied Grad-CAM for explainability. The results are visualized with interactive dashboards (Streamlit, Plotly, Folium), allowing users to explore environmental changes over time and even predict future trends."
